Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you really need to 
have a contact form on your static website, but can't justify using 
a 3rd party servise for such a simple and mundane task of getting data 
in a POST request, slapping some HTML on it and sending resulting mess 
to a list of recepients?

I sure have!

So this little app right here might provide you with a long sought 
self-hosted, almost-zero-config remedy to this problem.
